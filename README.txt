IOOI: A free educational application for any offline device. 

There is an abundance of high quality educational content online, but 60% of the world is not on the Internet. It will take decades for the Internet to reach them, leaving generations of learners behind. 

The approach of most online learning websites is to simply wait for the Internet to reach people, focusing on serving those who already have connectivity. In the process, we’re leaving out the children who could most benefit from the potential of a high quality education - those with  poor access to schools, large class sizes, and poorly trained teachers. We are condemning generations  of children to remain stuck in a cycle of poverty, with little education, few opportunities, and no hope.

This is not acceptable.

We’re not willing to wait -- we believe it’s essential to act now to make the offline learning revolution a reality, and give these students the opportunities they need to break this cycle of poverty. 

This is where IOOI would be super applicable. Be part of the Change makers
